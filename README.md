## A simple todo app

Built as a learning experience for T3 stack.
Feel free to use both for an app and/or for educational purposes.

## What is [T3 stack](https://init.tips/)?

It is a technological stack popularized by [Theo](https://t3.gg/) that focuses on TypeScript, tRPC, and Tailwind in the combination with Next.js. It could be easily created using [create-t3-app](https://create.t3.gg/), but this app wasn't created with this initializer. Instead, all parts were manually added one by one in order to better understand how it works.

## Stack:

- TypeScript - because it is better than JavaScript
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - framework used for both Frontend and Backend hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database - hosted on [Railway](https://railway.app/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) - TypeScript ORM
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) - for end-to-end typesafe APIs
  - [ReactQuery](https://tanstack.com/query/v4) - used by tRPC under the hood as an asynchronous state management tool
  - [zod](https://zod.dev/) - TypeScript schema validation tool
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - for easier styling
- [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) - open source authentication solution for Next.js
- [AutoAnimate](https://auto-animate.formkit.com/) - zero-config simple animations
- [ClassNames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames#readme) - utility for conditionally joining classNames together
